# 6.4 - Binomial Coefficients and Identities 

1. (The Binomial Theorem): let $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$, then 
$(x+y)^n = (n 0)x^0 y^n + (n 1)x^1 y^{n-1} + (n 2)x^2 y^{n-2} + \dots\ + (n n-1)x^{n-1} y1 + (n n)x^n y^0$

2. Use the binomial theorem to expand $(3x - 2y)^18$ into a sum of terms of the form $cx^ay^b$ where $c$ is a real number
and $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative integers. What is the coefficent of $x^14 y^4$ in this expansion?
