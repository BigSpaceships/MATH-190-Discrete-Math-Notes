# Predicates and Quantifieres

### 1.4.2 - Predicates

1. For x a real number, let $p(x)$ be the proposition $x+3=7$. 
Then, $p(3)$, $p(4)$, and $p(\pi)$ are all propositions because they are either true or false

- $p(x)$ is call a proposiitonal function
- $x+3=7$ is called the predicate
- the set of values that x can possibliy be in the porpoositional function is called the universe of discourse or the domain

2. Let $R(x,y)$ be the propositional function $R(x,y): x+y=4$ where x and y are integers.
$R(1,2)$ is false but $R(1,3)$ is true

(Propositional functions can have multiple variables)

3. (Goldbach's conjecture): Let q(n) be the proposition q(n): "n can be written as the sum of two prime numbers" where the domain is the positive even integers.

$\bigwedge\limits_{b=2}^\inf q(2n)$
