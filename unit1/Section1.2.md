3. 
Mr. Spock tells his two children, a boy (Syvar) and a
girl (Valeris), to play in their backyard without getting dirty.
While playing, however, both children get mud on their foreheads.

When the children stop playing, Spock says
“At least one of you has a muddy forehead,”
and asks them to answer “Yes” or “No” to the question:
“Do you know whether you have a muddy forehead?”
Spock asks this question twice.

What will the children answer each time to this question is asked?

Answer: 

The first time they would say no because if the other person doesn't have mud on their forehead then they would have
to have mud on their forehead because at least one has to have a muddy forehead

The second time they know that the other person was unsure and therefore they must also have mud on their forehead
