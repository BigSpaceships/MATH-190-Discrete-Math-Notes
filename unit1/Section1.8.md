# 1.8 Proof methods and Strategy

### 1.8.2 - Exhaustive proof and proof by cases

1. Suppose $n$ is an odd integer. Show that there exists and integer $k$ such that $n^2=8k+1$
> [Proof]
> Suppose $n$ is odd.
> By definition, there exists an integer $k$ such that $n=2k+1$.
> Squaring both sides gives $n^2=(2k+1)^2=4k^2+4k+1$
