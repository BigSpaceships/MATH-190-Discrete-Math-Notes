# 2.5 - Cardinality of Sets

## 2.5.1 - Intro

1. Two sets $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality, written as $|A|=|B|$. if there is a bijection between two sets

$A=\{1,2,3\}$
$B=\{x,y,z\}$
$f=\{(1,x),(2,y),(3,z)\}$

Thus, $|A|=|B|$

2. Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. We say $A$ has less than or the same cardianlity than $B$, written $|A|\leq|B|$ 
if there exists a 1-1 function $f:A\to B$

## 2.5.2 - Countable sets

3. Let A be a set.
- A is countable if it is finite if $|A|=|\matbb{Z}^+|$
- A is countabley infinite if $|A|=|\matbb{Z}^+|$
- A is uncountable if it is not countable

4. Hilbert Hotel. This hotel has infinitely many rooms labled $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4,...$

a) a guest arrives in the middle of the night at the hotel to find no vacency. How can the night clerk accomodate the guest?

Everyone moves one more room over 

b) the bus contains an infinite number of people. How can the accomodate

Move from room $n$ to $2n$
